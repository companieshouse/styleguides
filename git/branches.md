Branch Naming Standards
================

- Should be all lower case.
- Must not include the hash character `#`.
- Should be descriptive (not just story/ticket number).
- Can be prefixed like a URI.
- Integration branch names should be in the format `feature/**/ci`

Examples
-------

- `feature/scrs/painfully-complicated-feature`
- `release/1.3.0`
- `feature/project-name/ci`
