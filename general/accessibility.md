# Accessibility Standards

Our services must be accessible to everyone who needs it. You may be breaking the law if you do not make your service accessible.

We must meet the government accessibility requirements:

- meet level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 as a minimum (see [understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag))
- work on the most commonly used [assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
- include disabled people in [user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research)
- have an [accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement#decide-if-anything-is-a-disproportionate-burden-to-fix-right-now) that explains how accessible the service is - you need to publish this when the service moves into public beta
