# Health check endpoint guidelines

When creating a new application a health check endpoint should be created as
standard. A Lambda does not require a Health check at present.

## End point Url

This should be `/healthcheck` .

## Minimum implementation

As a minimum this should return `200` when the application is up and available.

## Additional implementation possibilities

None of the below possibilities are essential but may help diagnose application
issues after you deploy:

* Is there disk space available on the machine your application is running on.
* Is the underlying database your application utilises contactable.
* Is Kafka available to your application.

## Specific implementation details
