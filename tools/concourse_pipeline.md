# Concourse Pipeline Standards

When creating a new Concourse pipeline, it's best practice to start by using an
existing
[template](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-pipelines/tree/master/templates).

## Pipeline Name

- Should be the same name as the GitHub repo containing the source code that
  it's building
- Although the pipeline is a YAML file, it should not have a `.yml` file
  extension

## Job and Resource Names

- All lowercase
- No underscores or spaces.... use hyphens
- No ampersands
- Try to keep names short

## Pipeline Structure

- Pipelines should be ordered by
  - Groups
  - Jobs
  - Resources
  - Resource
- Groups must have an `All` that contains all jobs in the pipeline

## Tasks

- No inline comments
- Try to avoid bespoke `config` and `run` commands in your tasks where
  possible.  The preferred option is to put it in a task in
  [Concourse Resource](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-concourse-resources)
  and call it using `file`.  This means it can be reused in other pipelines and
  makes your pipeline cleaner and easier to read and maintain.

## Resource Icons

- Only use an approved icon for your `Resources`.  Currently, these are:
  - ![bitbucket](../concourse_icons/bitbucket.png) **bitbucket** - used for S3
    release buckets (the name is misleading but it's the only bucket icon
    available)
  - ![docker](../concourse_icons/docker.png) **docker** - used for Docker images
  - ![folder-zip](../concourse_icons/folder-zip.png) **folder-zip** - used for
    `maven-repository`
  - ![github-circle](../concourse_icons/github-circle.png) **github-circle** -
    used for GitHub repos
  - ![human](../concourse_icons/human.png) **human** - used for accessibility
    testing
  - ![iframe](../concourse_icons/iframe.png) **iframe** - used for `taf-source`
  - ![package-variant-closed](../concourse_icons/package-variant-closed.png)
    **package-variant-closed** - used for releases
  - ![slack](../concourse_icons/slack.png) **slack** - used for `notify-slack`
  - ![source-merge](../concourse_icons/source-merge.png) **source-merge** - used
    for analysing pull-requests
  - ![tag](../concourse_icons/tag.png) **tag** - used for `release-tag`
  - ![timer](../concourse_icons/timer.png) **timer** - used for `time` resources
  - ![xml](../concourse_icons/xml.png) **xml** - used for XML files such as
    pom.xml
