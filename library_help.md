# Libraries

## Assessing a library for use by CH


### Functionality Relevance
* Does the library provides the specific functionality needed for your application?
* Read the documentation and examples: do the library's features align with your project requirements?

### Community Support and Activity
Assess the library's community support and activity level. A strong and active community often indicates a well-maintained and reliable library.
Check:
* community forums
* GitHub activity
* Number and nature of maintainers. Does the library only have one maintainer, or only one person committing the vast majority of the code? If so, they will be at risk of burn-out, or being hired by a company that forbids them to work further on the library.
* Maintainers' responsiveness to issues.
* Age of library. Is this a brand-new project? If so, perhaps there are older projects that have stood the test of time and shown that their maintainer(s) will still be around to support the project.
* The library is actively maintained and updated to support the relevant dependencies in your application.
* Security history of the library. Has it had security issues in the past and, if so, how quickly were they addressed?

### Documentation Quality and Accessibility
Evaluate the quality and accessibility of the library's documentation this should include clear and comprehensive documentation. A well-documented library helps developers understand its usage, reducing the learning curve and potential implementation issues.

### Licensing and Compatibility
Review the library's licensing terms to ensure they have a permissive licence such as MIT or Apache Licence 2.0. Check for compatibility with your technology stack, including the specific versions of Java or Node.js that your application uses.

## Adding a library to Companies House

### Adding the library
Developers do not have write permissions to Artifactory, so please request Platform to add the library on your behalf through the Artifactory Query in the Platform channel on Slack.

### Artifactory link
To verify whether your library has been successfully added, use the following link. Ensure that you are connected to the VPN.
