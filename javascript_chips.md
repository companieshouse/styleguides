# JavaScript Coding Standards

Use the Chips Java Coding Standard where ever it makes sense. In particular
with regard to: Formatting and indentation Naming convention (methods and
variables start with lower case, classes start with upper case, constants in
all upper case, etc.).

Documentation - although we do not have any javadoc formatter for JavaScript it
makes sense to document JavaScript code using the same conventions.

Mandatory curly braces for if, for and while.

Semicolons - Terminate every statement with a semicolon even though they are
not required.

## Additional Rules

### File names

Since JavaScript files typically contain multiple classes, naming the file
after a class as in Java doesn't neccessarily make sense. To make this
explicit, names of JavaScript files should start with a lower case letter and
indicate the functionality it provides. For example:

**table.js** - contains the classes Table and Row
**query-handling.js** - contain functionality specific to the chips query
handling module.

Simulate instance methods by assinging the them to the object's prototype. For
example.

````javascript
Table.prototype.movetoRow = function(offset) { ... };
````

Simulate “static” (class) variables and methods by assigning them to the
constructor method. For example:

````javascript
Table.findRelativeRow = function(row) { ... };
Calendar.MONTH_MODE = 1;   
Calendar.YEAR_MODE = 2;
````

To use these “static” methods the containing object must always be specified,
even within methods belonging to the containing objects. For example:

````javascript
if(Calendar.MONTH_DATE == 1) ...
````

Minimize the number of global methods and objects - Any top level variable or
method declared in any javascript file imported by the HTML page is visible to
all other javascript code, inviting a name clash. The number of global
variables and methods should be kept to a minimum. Instead create a “class” for
it. For example:

````javascript
function StringUtil() { ... };
StringUtil.CHIPS_DATA_FORMAT = "dd/mm/yy";
StringUtil.formatDate = new function(date) { ... };
````

Alternatively create an object literal containing the neccessary members. For
example:

````javascript
StringUtil = {
    CHIPS_DATE_FORMAT: "dd/mm/yy",
    formatDate: function(date) { ... };
}
````

or

````javascript
QueryHandling = {
    REJECTED_IMAGE : "images/qha/rejected.png",
    ACCEPTED_IMAGE : "images/qha/rejected.png",
    ERROR_FLAG_IMAGE: "image/qha/error_flag.png",
    parseFieldId: function(id) { ... }
}
````

In the same vein avoid creating global variables inside methods. A variable
that not declared using the “var” keyword will become global. It can then
overwrite a same named variable instantiated in another method or in the global
scope. The same goes for variables in for loops:

````javascript
for(var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
   ...
}
````

### Link to previous event handlers

When assigning a method to handle and event such as body.onload, if it cannot
be taken for granted that some other piece of code also isn't responding to or
won't be responding to this event, then take the precaution to link to any
previous handler. For example:

````javascript
myPage = {
 
    oldHandlBodyLoad: page.handleBodyLoad
     
    handleBodyLoad = function(event) {
        if(oldHandleBodyLoad) {
            oldHandleBodyLoad(event);
        }
        // page specific stuff
    }
}
   
page.handleBodyLoad = myPage.handleBodyLoad;
````
