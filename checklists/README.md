# Checklists

The checklists contained within this directory can be used to help bring a
repository up to the required standard.

## One off checklist

The purpose of this checklist is to provide a checklist covering checks which
only need to be done once for a repository/service so once this has been
completed it should not need to be strictly necessary to check this again.

## Periodic checklist

The purpose of this checklist is to guide checks to be performed on a
repository on a regular basis based on things which may have changed since
the last check.
