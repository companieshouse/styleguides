# Accessibility Standards

## Background

Regulations came into force on 23 September 2018 for public sector bodies to
make websites or mobile apps more accessible, by making them ‘perceivable,
operable, understandable and robust’. Your website or app will meet the new
public sector requirement to be more accessible if it complies with the
international WCAG accessibility standard. Follow the advice and
guidelines in the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service).
