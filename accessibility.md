# Accessibility Standards

## Background

Regulations came into force on 23 September 2018 for public sector bodies to make websites or mobile apps more accessible, by making them ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’. Your website or app will meet the new public sector requirement to be more accessible if it complies with the international WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard. Follow the advice and guidlelines in the [GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).
